# Analysis and Challenges 
   The overview of the analyis is that the category theater was the most successful with its subcategory plays. The difficulites that I encountered was with getting to know excel with the limited time I had between work. Overcoming this was focusing on the subject piece by piece and searching the web for alternatives of a easier way to solve my problems with the project.
# Results
   Two conclsuion are that the most successful month for launch dates will be in may the afterwards it seems to have a negative trend. So if Louise wants to launch it should be in May or before for the best outcome.
